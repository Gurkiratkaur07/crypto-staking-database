### SQL Database Project

In this project, I designed and implemented a structured relational database using SQL, focusing on establishing strong data relationships and ensuring data integrity. 

#### **Key Features:**
- **Database Design**: Created a comprehensive database with multiple tables, establishing connections using primary and foreign keys to maintain referential integrity and ensure accurate data relationships.
- **Primary and Foreign Keys**: Used primary keys to uniquely identify records in each table and foreign keys to establish relationships between tables, enforcing data consistency across the database.
- **Trigger Implementation**: Developed `AFTER INSERT` triggers to automate actions whenever new data is added to the tables. This ensured that related tables were updated automatically, maintaining data synchronization and integrity.

#### **Learning Outcomes:**
- Improved my understanding of database design and normalization by working with primary and foreign keys.
- Gained hands-on experience with SQL triggers to automate data processes, enhancing data management efficiency.

This project provided me with practical experience in designing databases, implementing triggers, and managing data relationships, which are crucial skills for handling complex data environments.
